# dotfiles
My current configuration of the dotfiles that I'm using in Linux.
Props to [Miguel Duarte](https://github.com/miguelpduarte/) for the suggestions.

## Current setyp:
- [`i3wm`](https://i3wm.org/): Because productivity
- [`rofi`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi): Better than the default dmenu
- `gnome-terminal`: I used to be a Gnome User, so I didn't see any reason to replace the terminal emulator
- [`polybar`](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar): An eye-candy bar!
- [`fusuma`](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma): Because I wanted to replicate the swiping of workspaces from Mac
- [`Dunst`](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst): I was suggested to use this notification daemon
